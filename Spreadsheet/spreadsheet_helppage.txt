SELECTING A CELL
	 Cells can be selected by:
		a) clicking on the desired cell
		b) using the arrow keys to navigate to the cell
	In either case the name of the cell will be displayed in the "Cell Name" text box in the header along with its respective value and contents next to that.
EDITING CELL CONTENTS
	1) To be edited, a cell must be selected. In the same header where we found the cell name, verify that the displayed name matches the cell you want to edit.  
	2) Click on the text box following the lable "formula." Here you can add a numerical value, words, or a Formula. The formula will be described later.
ENTERING A GENERIC FORMULA
	This spreadsheet can evaluate formulas! To use formulas, make sure that you have entered normal, floating point numbers into the cells you want to be used in this relationship
	-To use a formula
	1) Select the cell you want to eventually hold the formula data using the methods descirbed above. Make sure to verify your cell name by checking the name property!
	2) In the "Formula" text box, type an equals ('=') character followed by the cells you want to operate against.
	Only the following operators may be used:
	- ( *, / ) Multiplication, Division
	- ( +, - ) Addition, Subtraction
	- Exponents are unsupported
	Note: Operations cannot be performed without at least two values, parentheses must have the same number of open and close parentheses.
OPERATING ON CELLS
	This Spreadsheet can operate on cell names! Cells have to have a numeric value or your spreadsheet will report a numeric value.
	To use cells in your formula
	1) Consider the formula "=2 + 2"
		-This evaluates to four
	2) Consider a spread sheet where "A1 = 2" and "A2 = 2"
		- This will also evaluate to four! 
		NOTE: All cell names must be of the form of a letter followed by a number. Letters are case insensitive, but must be only a single letter. Numbers may be any value [1 - 99] (one through ninety-nine).
