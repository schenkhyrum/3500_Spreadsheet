Assignment: Assignment Three - Formula class

1.Comments to Evaluators
	I underestimated this assignment. Many of the new ideas like operators were confusing at the get go and the interaction 
	of the different methods was not as intuitive as I took it to be when I first copied the API.

2. Assignment Specific Topics:
	Hours Estimate/Worked		Assignment		Note
		5		/	12		Assignment3 - formula	This was much more complicated than I thought it would be.

3.Consulted Peers
	I did not have any peers to discuss this with.
