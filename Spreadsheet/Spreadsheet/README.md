------------------------|---------------|------------------------------
10	/	8	|	Assignment 1 - Formula Evaluator  |   Will have to spend more time rebuilding the code I wrote to meet the tests
8	/	6	|	Assignment 2 - Dependency Graph   |  Took me longer than it could have, I procrastinated a lot.
5	/	12	|	Assignment 3 - Formula			  |	This was much more complicated than I thought it would be.
10	/	16	|	Assignment 4 - Onward To a Spreadsheet|   I had to spend a lot of time rebuilding other classes to make this work.
12 /	7	|	Assignment 5 - Spreadsheet Model	|	This was so incredibly vague until it wasn't. Why did it take so long?

## Examples of Good Software Practice
Code Reuse - I was able to make a couple of private methods for simple repeated actions. Additionally, with the constructors
	I was able to use the base constructor to set the standards for the abstract spreadsheet instead of trying to do it over again
	in every instance of the constructor.
- Reression testing - I did not delete and was able to update my old tests to test my new code
- seperation of concerns - I was able to make a handful of private methods to handle small, repetitious actions.
